 We are using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to distribute and provide version control for your assignment code.

Below are some additional info that can help with your D3 assignments:

## Tips

* [Here is a cheatsheet for git usage](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

* After you clone a repo, make sure to `cd` into the new folder before starting your web server.

## GUI Clients

You are welcome to use your favorite GUI clients for git rather than the command line / terminal. Some IDEs also include a git GUI. Some examples:
*  On Windows, [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) is great and integrates with the filesystem.
* On Windows and Mac, [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is also nice.
* See [many more here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
